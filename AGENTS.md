# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a personal learning repository for Machine Learning and AI exploration ("Exploración de Machine Learning e Inteligencia Artificial"). The repository is in **constant expansion** and serves as a space for:

- Documenting ML/IA learning processes
- Quick tests and prototypes
- Examples using AI frameworks, libraries, and services
- Mini projects and demos
- Useful notes and references

## Language

**Primary language: Spanish (Español)**
- Documentation, comments, and commit messages should be in Spanish
- Code variables and functions can be in English or Spanish depending on context
- README and documentation files are written in Spanish

## Repository Structure

```
/
├── README.md                    # Main repository documentation (Spanish)
├── gemini-CLI/                  # Google Gemini CLI experiments and use cases
│   └── casos-de-uso/           # Use case examples and demonstrations
└── [future directories]         # Notebooks, experiments, and projects to be added
```

## Expected Content Types

According to the README, this repository will contain:
- **Experimental notebooks** (Python, Jupyter, Google Colab)
- **Proof of concepts (PoCs)**
- **AI tool examples**
- **Mini projects and demos**
- **Notes and useful references**

## Technologies and Tools

The following technologies may appear in this repository:
- Python
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- Scikit-learn
- Hugging Face
- Copilot / OpenAI APIs
- LangChain
- FastAPI / Streamlit
- Vectorization and embeddings tools
- Foundation models (LLMs)

## Development Guidelines

### When Adding New Content

1. **Experiments and notebooks**: Create descriptive directory names that reflect the learning topic or experiment
2. **Use cases**: Place under appropriate subdirectories (e.g., `gemini-CLI/casos-de-uso/`)
3. **Documentation**: Each significant experiment or project should include a README.md or explanatory markdown file in Spanish

### Git Workflow

- Main branch: `main`
- This is a personal learning repository with a linear commit history
- Commit messages should be in Spanish and descriptive of the learning or experiment

### File Organization

- Group related experiments in subdirectories
- Keep top-level directory clean with only major categories
- Use descriptive names in Spanish for directories and files when appropriate
- Documentation files should use `.md` extension

## Notes for AI Assistants

- This is an **active learning repository** - new technologies and approaches will be added frequently
- The structure is flexible and organic, reflecting the learning journey
- When suggesting code or experiments, consider that this is for learning purposes - explanations are valuable
- Suggest best practices but acknowledge that experimental code may not follow production standards
- Be prepared to work with various AI/ML frameworks as they are explored
